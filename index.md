# kosmos-craftoom

A messy studio full of odds and ends for working with the [KOSMOS](https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/Instruments/KOSMOS/userguide.html) spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory (APO). This collection of tools is design to help streamline a few small steps in the process!


Existing resources:
- [The KOSMOS User Guide](https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/Instruments/KOSMOS/userguide.html) shares comprehensive details about the instrument and how to observe with it at APO.
- [pyKOSMOS](https://github.com/jradavenport/pykosmos) has a set reduction tools for extracting spectra from KOSMOS data.
- [specreduce](https://github.com/astropy/specreduce) is an `astropy`-affiliated package that may in the long term be a good resource for analyzing KOSMOS data.
- Adam Kowalski has some quicklook tools coming soon that might be super useful!


Please explore, use, or contribute to the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/zkbt/kosmos-craftroom), or read on here for basic usage.
